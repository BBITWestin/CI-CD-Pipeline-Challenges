# Hours

4 different weekends. some of these days I spent only a couple hours, others I
spent the entire weekend on (14 hours per day).

I don't have exact logs but lets say this adds up to 70 hours. I think this is a
pretty conservative estimate as well.

Next up ever since June 28th I've spent anywhere from 1 to 6 hours ontop of my
40 hour weeks. I would be working on quote bot 1 day per week where I would
almost ALWAYS stay later than the 9-5's as an 8-4. Then on fridays I would
always spend the time after pizza working on quote bot. This would lead to me
staying extra late sometimes. Some fridays I left between 4 and 5, others I
stayed til 6, 7, 8, 9, 10pm (this is excluding my all nighter which was included
in the first estimate above).

Lets be conservative and say I was averaging 2 hours after work each week.

Todays date is 10/30/24 so since June 28th that's another 35 hours.

This puts me at 105 hours.

This next part I would understand if you don't want to count it but about 1/3 of
the days between june 28th and oct 30 I wouldn't take lunch break to lift. Thats
another 30 hours.
