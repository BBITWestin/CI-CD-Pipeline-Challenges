- How do I say all this without sounding like an absolute selfless douchebag?

## PROJECT PORTAL

- When it comes to project portal there were a couple of phases. The first phase
  was research weeks, the second was start up, and the third phase was when we
  started tracking effor value.

- When it comes to the second phase (start up) were talking about getting the
  app ready for tasks. This encompasses everything from getting the repo set up,
  provisioning everything, setting up azure b2c...

  - I was solely responsible for the majority of tasks in this phases and showed
    up to code review every single week with a groundbreaking amount of work
    done... just ask anybody from transportation team they will tell you the
    same thing. Although most of us still put in about the same amount of hours
    nobody came close to the amount of progress I was making on portals.

- In the third phase where we starting tracking effor value we can start to
  quantify my impact on the project.
  - As of 7/5/2024 I am responsible for 96 out of 124 effort value points
    (77.4%).
  - Keep in mind this is a project for a team of 6 people! And even tho several
    people have other side projects I've been able to put up these numbers while
    working on quote bot and the bbilogistics site, AND while frequently helping
    others with devops work. For example I've taken several afternoons to help
    Misha and andrew when they started learning more about azure, IOC, and
    github actions.

## QUOTE BOT

#### Start up (Iteration #1: March 5th - June 14th)

- Working once per week and most Friday afternoons.

- In the beginning of the project I led Viraj through some basic azure, bicep,
  yml, and github actions training.

- I started the project off by finding that research paper on ML in freight
  prediction and put together a rough plan / outline for the project.

- Responsible for the entire data preprocessing pipeline (yes, all of it)

  - Viraj was involved in some of the email reading research early on and some
    of the research but when it came to actually getting the tasks done I am
    responsible for every single line of code used in the data preprocessing
    pipeline.

- There were many weeks during this time where Viraj was caught up in BPAID
  work. I ended up getting further and further into the project and it became
  difficult for Viraj to keep up and stay familiar with everything going on in
  the project. It got to a point where It felt like half the time I spent with
  Viraj was simply catching him up on the work I've done since seeing eachother
  last. And then the second half of the time I'd continue making progress while
  Viraj became familiar with the new changes in our codebase.

#### Start up (CEREBRO MILESTONE: Iteration #2: June 17th - June 28th)

- 2 Week sprint completely dedicated to quote bot project.

  - I stayed every day from 7:45am-5:00pm at the minimum without lunches some
    days
  - Pulled an all nighter in the office Friday June 19th leaving at 10am (this
    was when I completed the entire analytics page in a single day: frontend,
    backend, batabase)

- Responsible for 125 out of 155 effort points (everything was tracked for this
  sprint)

- Any tasks that was assigned to both of us was completed on my computer while I

  explained what I was doing to Viraj (stuff like teaching sql db provisioning)

- I havn't been trying to put viraj down at all in this, but how else can I show
  how big of an imact I had on the project other than by showing how much work I
  completed compared to others working in the same project... in this case just
  Viraj.
  - There were multiple weeks where Viraj was unable to work on quote bot at all
  - There were 3-4 weeks where when Viraj did have time to work on quote bot but
    ended up using the time to reset his new computers.
  - There were multiple weeks where Viraj was able to dedicate some time to
    quote bot but had to spend this time catching up on the changes/work that I
    had made in the meantime.
  - There were multiple weeks where the only time Viraj was able to work on
    quote bot was after pizza for just a few hours.

#### Update (10/30/24)

- Just putting dates here for reference later.

- When we first talked about this project the first soft deadline was to have a
  proof of concept app only using peruse data and the ml model by september
  first. We ended up releases on septemper 5th but with a hell of a lot more
  functionality. The main prediction that wack ended up wanting was the average
  of comparable loads for spot rate and bulk predictions. Ontop of the original
  proof of concept I was asked to create the admin page for brent/wack to manage
  the app.

- I also completed all of this while being the main and sometimes only
  contributor to the project as Viraj was very focused on b-paid.

## BBILOGISTICS.COM

I've acomplished the above all while working on the bbilogistics.com site from
time to time. Couple hour task every 2 weeks or so.
