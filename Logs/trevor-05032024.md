- RBAC CRUD

# My Last Week

# Project Portal DevOps Roadmap

(as of 4/22/2024)

High Priority:

- [x] (est <1 day): RBAC `CRU` (not `CRUD`) calls to create users, teams, custom
      roles, role assignments.

Medium Priority:

- ANYONE + JACOB: (est ?) Finalize what we want our list of granular permissions
  to look like and what our default roles will be.
- [x]: (est 3-5+ days?) Email Invite flow: Find the plan
  [here](https://github.com/bbi-dev-ops/project-portal-management/blob/dev/DOCS/B2C_INVITES.md).
  - [x] Includes email integration, backend logic for invites
        (controller+handler in onion), ms graph calls to delete "bad" users, and
        a process to get ms graph api tokens from an app registration.
- [x] (IAN) PR key vault access policy task mentioned above.

Low Priority:

- IAN OR TREVOR: (est 2-3 days): B2C User Attribute for `UserRole` (Guest,
  Member SuperAdmin)
  - We want to store the users _generic_ role in b2c instead of our database.
    This way it will be included in the token claims sent to the backend for
    fast and easy preliminary auth checks to filter out any request that don't
    need to check role assignments (RBAC).
  - We will need a way to init and set this attribute. MS-Graph controller?
- [x] TREVOR: (est 1 day) Version control ids and version control middleware
      (code included from research week email)
- Blue Green Deployment
  - Blue Green slot provisioning
  - Deployment slot swapping
  - Workflow updates as needed
  - Roll back procedures
