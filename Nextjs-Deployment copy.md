# Deploying Nextjs to Azure Static Web Apps

This document fills in some of the gaps left out by Azure's tutorial on how to [Deploy hybrid Next.js websites on Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/deploy-nextjs-hybrid).

Hybrid refers to any Next.js feature from nextjs 13+

> [!CAUTION]
> Next.js hybrid support is in preview, with limited support for Next.js versions 13 and above.

## Set Up

1. Rather than create the next app with `npm init next-app@next-12-3-2 --typescript` as suggested by the tutorial we want to use the latest version of Next!!!

```

```
