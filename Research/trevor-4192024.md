## Multi Tenant B2C Solutions: [B2C Tenants](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory%2Fb2cDirectories) Resouce Group

1. BBI Portal
2. BBI Management Portal Dev

#### How I did it:

- There are now two main scripts in the `./srcripts/` directory:

  1. `b2c_manager.ps1`
  2. `b2c_multi_tenant_manager.ps1`

- Our steps to recreate document has been updated to explain how you would go about creating a single tenant solution as well as our new multi tenant solution. See [here](https://github.com/bbi-dev-ops/project-portal-management/blob/dev/DOCS/RECREATE.md#first-time-setup).

  - The single tenant solution is simply what we had beforehand and has not changed.
  - The new multi tenant solution will prompt you to enter the desired b2c tenant name and id for each env (dev, stage, prod).
    - Unforetunately the script doesn't handle everything and you will need to do a few extra things per tenant:
      - Create the default user flows
      - Create the B2C redirect url manager app registration (script included in steps to recreate) and update the preview set up workflow and cleanup preview workflow to use the correct app registration.

- The reason we want different tenants for dev, stage, and prod is so you can't use the same credentials as dev for prod.

> [!NOTE]
> The current solution groups stage and prod into the same tenant. Is this what we want?

## App Service Identities & Key Vault Access Policies

#### How We Fixed Hosted Dev

- Problem: Any call to hosted dev would return html with "Failed to start".
- Solution: Add the app service to the key vault access policies with get and list permissions.
- Ian suggested the key vault access policies were the issue.
  - Wasn't working for the longest time because I added get and list **key** permissions not **secret** permissions.

#### Side Quest For Sombody

<details><summary>Side Quest</summary>
If anyone has any interest in learning more about how I set up preview environments and wants to get their hands dirty I've got a task for somebody to take.

Background: Our app services (backend) need to reach out to the key vault in their respective resource group to grab secrets like the database connection string. In order for the app service to do this it needs to have the `List` and `Get` **secrets** permissions in the key vault **Access Policies**. In order to create an access policy for an app service the app service must have the `Identity Status` switched from off to on.

Your Mission if you choose to accept it:

- In the `preview-environment.yml` add a job after the `create_deployment_slot` job to turn on the `Identity Status` for this new slot.
- In the `preview-environment.yml` add a job after `Identity Status` is turned on to create an access policy in the `kv-management-dev-tnpv` key vault with **Secret permissions** `Get` and `List` and make sure the `Principal` is set the **object id** generated for the deployment slot which can be found after turning `Identity Status` on.
- In the `preview-environment.yml` ensure `build_deploy_backend_slot` depends on these first two steps to prevent the backend from failing on start up.
- In the `cleanup_preview.yml` add a job to remove the access policy for the deleted app service deployment slot.

## AUTH RBAC

[Da Docs](https://github.com/bbi-dev-ops/project-portal-management/blob/dev/DOCS/ACCESS_CONTROL.md)

#### POSTMAN

- Check out the [postman collection](https://blue-sunset-71381.postman.co/workspace/74a1e651-c62d-40ab-be45-03fbbfeee373)

#### Benefits of documenting your work...

Your task is to create all the CRUD calls (controller and service implementation layers) for the entire auth schema attached:

- CRUD Roles
- CRUD User
- CRUD Team (including adding and removing team members)
- CRUD role assignments

Notes:

- Instead of deleting anything all the delete calls should just set the isActive prop to false.
- We return everything in `IActionResult`.
- Make the entire controller and service implementation for each category before moving onto the next.

Here is the shcema:

# Project Portal DevOps Roadmap

(as of 4/22/2024)

High Priority:

- ANYONE: (est <1 day): RBAC `CRU` (not `CRUD`) calls to create users, teams, custom roles, role assignments.
- IAN OR TREVOR: (est 2-3 days): B2C User Attribute for `UserRole` (Guest, Member SuperAdmin)
  - We want to store the users _generic_ role in b2c instead of our database. This way it will be included in the token claims sent to the backend for fast and easy preliminary auth checks to filter out any request that don't need to check role assignments (RBAC).
  - We will need a way to init and set this attribute. MS-Graph controller?

Medium Priority:

- ANYONE + JACOB: (est ?) Finalize what we want our list of granular permissions to look like and what our default roles will be.
- ANYONE: (est 3-5+ days?) Email Invite flow: Find the plan [here](https://github.com/bbi-dev-ops/project-portal-management/blob/dev/DOCS/B2C_INVITES.md).
  - Includes email integration, backend logic for invites (controller+handler in onion), ms graph calls to delete "bad" users, and a process to get ms graph api tokens from an app registration.
- [x] (IAN) PR key vault access policy task mentioned above.

Low Priority:

- (est <1 day) Update Auth RBAC handlers to go full onion (repo layer + service layer instead of just service layer)
- TREVOR: (est 1 day) Version control ids and version control middleware (code included from research week email)
- ANYONE: (est 3-5+ days?) Blue Green Deployment
  - Blue Green slot provisioning
  - Deployment slot swapping
  - Workflow updates as needed
  - Roll back procedures
