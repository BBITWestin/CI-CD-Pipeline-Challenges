# :sparkles: Last Last Week :sparkles:

- Program.cs ... secret client and default credentials.
- Azure Email Service

# This Week Overview

## Email invite flow

- Different B2C user flows for susi (1 for su 1 for si)
- Adding the user to the database
- Passing the invited email through a jwt token sent as a link in the invite
  email (using azure email service from last week)
- Invite link sends user to site where we validate the jwt token before
  redirecting to the sign up user flow
- On every succesfull sign up or sign in we collect the signed in users email
  from their azure msal instance and send it to our backend to make sure they
  are in the database (ur added when you get invited) and if not we sign them
  out and `DELETE` their azure account.

## Automatic Database updates on deployments

- Program.cs applies migrations automatically!
- There's a catch
  - Deployment time: ~8 MINUTES!
  - [Best practice](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli#apply-migrations-at-runtime):
    "Experience has shown that the simplicity of this deployment strategy is
    outweighed by the issues it creates".

## Version control id middleware

- Github actions automatically reads the version number from actions variables,
  increments, and publishes the new version.

- Footer status:
  - If versions mismatch refresh the page
  - If the version id fetch fails display red
  - If it passes but returns a different number display yellow
  - If its loading display black
  - If it matches display green!
